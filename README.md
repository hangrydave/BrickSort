# BrickSort

A simple app to view the inventory of a Lego set.

To run, install the [Ionic framework](https://ionicframework.com/) on your machine, and then run:

```
npm install  
ionic serve
```

Once you're in the app you'll need a [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/home/) API key, so make sure you've signed up for an account there and set up an API key.
